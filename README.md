# Loan Default Predictor

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/loan-default <br />
I took the above dataset from Kaggle about loan defaults, and I cleaned that data and did exploratory data analysis. I then created a machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to predict whether an individual would default on their loan or not. I hyper-tuned the parameters for my model and I achieved an accuracy score of 88.7%. I also created a Flask application that utilizes my model and gives predictions, but due to the size of some of the files I was unable to deploy it. Below is a link to a screen recording of the application running on my local environment. <br />

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

In order to run the Jupyter Notebook, one must install Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. 

### Executing program

To execute this program, one needs to simply download the CSV file and notebook in this repository and run the cells. If the above packages are installed the model should run and work properly.
