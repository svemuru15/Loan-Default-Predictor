# Loan Default Predictor

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/loan-default <br />
I took the above dataset from Kaggle about loan defaults, and I cleaned that data and did exploratory data analysis. I then created a machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to predict whether an individual would default on their loan or not. I hyper-tuned the parameters for my model and I achieved an accuracy score of 88.7%. I also created a Flask application that utilizes my model and gives predictions, but due to the size of some of the files I was unable to deploy it. Below is a link to a screen recording of the application running on my local environment. <br />
